<p>In the <a href="http://bob.thusoy.com/robot-badass-strategy.html">previous article</a> we saw our basic strategy, which hasn't changed a lot throughout the project. Until recently!</p>
<p>Over the last few days, we tried to optimize the code and changed some aspects in Robert's behaviour:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We now start with full magazine (one ball already on the arm), start our patrol and immediately throw this ball when we reach the net.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some balls are placed close to the net and thanks to our routine having been optimized, those balls are caught and thrown quickly afterwards. 
This is a pretty huge improvement because the robot used to finish his turn (~19s) before throwing this ball over the net. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We plan to optimize also the turning detection, which you will get more information about in a new article.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Basically, our program runs thanks to three main tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>collect</em>, which uses the color sensor and keeps making the arm rotate until we catch a red or a blue ball (which sets the flag ballLoaded).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>trace</em>, which prevents our robot from running into the net in case we have performed a bad turn. If it's the case, the robot stops and changes direction to go away from the net.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>our <em>main</em>, which in essence starts with a setup of the unmetioned sensors and applies the strategy we've talked about, making calls to collect and trace at the right time.
We also use a Bluetooth connection with the NXT in order to get directly information about the robot on a computer. We already showed the code for the server <a href="http://bob.thusoy.com/anal-expulsiveness.html">here</a> abd also added two files for our robot, btio and btlog, that waits for a connection and enables the robot to send messages.</p>
</li>
</ul>
