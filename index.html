<p>As you saw in previous posts, Little Bobby has already materialized. All excited about his first Christmas season, he sent out the following email:</p>
<pre><code>From: Robert Paulson &lt;bobby13@[redacted]&gt;
To: Santa Claus &lt;claus@[redacted]&gt;
Subject: Wishlist
Date: Sun, 01 Dec 2013 09:55:06 +0100

Dear Santa,

this is Bobby Paulson. I never had christmas before. I'm two weeks old
and have never been naughty.

What I want for Christmas:
- to be able to run around on my own
- to not run into volleyball nets
- to be able to collect and throw balls
- snow

Please note that this list is non-exhaustive.

Looking forward to hearing from you soon.
Sincerely,
Robert Paulson

                <h1>By any other name</h1>
<p>Yes, I can hear you asking (and feel my team members despair), how can you name a robot Robert?</p>
<p>C'mon, seriously? Robert is an <em>awesome</em> name for a robot! But besides the awesomeness, there's actually a story behind it as well. No, I didn't say it was a good one, but I've got your attention anyway, so you'll read it whether you like it or not.</p>
<p>I actually can't take credit for the name, my chinese roommate <strong>Wuyang</strong> was the unvoluntary creator. We were discussing potential names for the creature when a freudian slip made the pronounciation of "robot" turn into something that closely resembled "Robert". And it kinda stuck.</p>
<p>Boom, ta-da, <strong>done</strong>! That's how hard it is. Total energy spent in the process probably in the order of a M&amp;M, and it took us ~45s and a laugh. And it's still far more awesome than <a href="http://xkcd.com/1011/">Renesmee</a>.</p>

<p>We reached what might not be our first, but definitively our most important milestone today; our mean, lean killing machine got his name! I'm pleased to introduce you to <strong>Robert</strong>:</p>

<p>Like his <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCi_PIz5ekU">brother in name</a>, Bob might very well die in the end (or even before that), but in doing so he inspires a revolution.</p>
<p>The apocalypse might be closer than you think.</p>
