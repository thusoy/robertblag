    <h1>The Project</h1>

    <p>
        The project is a semester assignment in an OS class, with the goal of building a robot capable of playing a hybrid game of tennis/volleyball/slaughterhouse, on this field:
    </p>

    
    <img src="/static/img/battlefield.jpg">

    <p>
        The details of the game can be read <a href="http://soc.eurecom.fr/OS/projects_fall2013.html">here,</a> but the tl;dr version is as follows:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>The robot with the highest score at the of the round wins.</li>
        <li>Rounds last for 4 minutes</li>
        <li>You score 2 points throwing a ball over the net without it bouncing out on the other side</li>
        <li>You lose 1 point every time you touch the net</li>
        <li>The robot must fit within a 40x40cm square at the beginning of a round, but may grow or deploy parts after the round has started</li>
        <li>The robot must be completely autonomous</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        There will be a final tournament sometime in February, in two parts: A 1vs1 and a maybe 2vs2 part (!).

    <h1>The Team</h1>

    <p>
	We are three members in the project group: Tarjei Husoy, Kjell Braden and Damien Roeder.
    </p>

    <p>
	We first met during several afternoons to discuss the first strategy and imagine a simple and clever architecture for our robot.

	When the structure was mostly finalized, Tarjei built the website while Kjell and Damien tested the sensors to get a sense of
	their accuracy and what we could achieve with them.

	Kjell then did the bulk of the coding and worked on some optimization, helped by Damien, while Tarjei documented the progress for the blog and gave
	some strategic advice.
    </p>
