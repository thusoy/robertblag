Just in time for his two-month birthday, we prepared a video to show you how much lil' Bobby has grown.

The time has come. On Monday, Robert 'Bobby' Paulson will compete with five other robots in a game of volleyball. During his last training session we captured a sneak peek. When asked to comment about the incident, he told he couldn't decide on whether to throw the red or the blue ball, so he went for both.

On a more serious note, you can clearly see [optimiziations talked about earlier](http://bob.thusoy.com/polishing-the-strategy.html): Bob is capable of throwing multiple balls at the net as well as cutting short on our patrol when finding a ball to throw.
