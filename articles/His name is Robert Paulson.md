Behold, he's got a name!

We reached what might not be our first, but definitively our most important milestone today; our mean, lean killing machine got his name! I'm pleased to introduce you to **Robert**:

Like his [brother in name](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCi_PIz5ekU), Bob might very well die in the end (or even before that), but in doing so he inspires a revolution.

The apocalypse might be closer than you think.
